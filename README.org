* Firmware
This repository contains source code for the firmware and application
code foir the Field-Programmable Smartwatch project.

** Directory Structure
#+BEGIN_SRC
applications/ Contains the application code that get executed from kernel space.

common/       Contains code that both application space and kernel space use.

kernel/       Contains kernel code that handles initializing the MCU, initializing the various
              tasks, and initializing/starting the task manager.

libraries/    Contains code that is utilized within various application code
#+END_SRC

** How To Build
First, you will need an ARM cross compiler. Please follow the
instructions [[https://github.com/Field-Programmable-Smartwatch/compiler][here]] to build your own cross compiler.

#+BEGIN_SRC
make COMPILER=[COMPILER PATH] SEAMOS_PATH=[SEAMOS PATH]
#+END_SRC

** How to Flash the bootloader to the smartwatch
Plug the stlink into the correct SWD pins and run the following make
target:

#+BEGIN_SRC
make flash
#+END_SRC

NOTE: A reset is required since the board will hard fault after
flashing the app to memory
