* Firmware
This repository contains source code for example programs and drivers
for the STM32wb55 microcontroller.

* How To Build
First, you will need an ARM cross compiler. Please follow the
instructions [[https://github.com/Field-Programmable-Smartwatch/compiler][here]] to build your own cross compiler.

#+BEGIN_SRC
cd <example project>
make
#+END_SRC
Please note that by default it will look for the cross compiler binary
in the path determined by CROSS_PATH which is in the example
Makefile.
