** How To Build
First, you will need an ARM cross compiler. Please follow the
instructions [[https://github.com/Field-Programmable-Smartwatch/compiler][here]] to build your own cross compiler.

#+BEGIN_SRC
make COMPILER=[COMPILER PATH] SEAMOS_PATH=[SEAMOS PATH]
#+END_SRC

** How to Flash the bootloader to the smartwatch
Reset the STM32 board while the boot pin is high. Then connect the
device to the computer via USB and run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC
make flash_kernel
#+END_SRC

Follow the same steps detailed above and run the following command

#+BEGIN_SRC
make flash_app
